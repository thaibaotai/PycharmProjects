<html><body><h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Your friend's suggestion surprised you a little bit. After a couple of "No, you" retaliations, you decided that it would be more convenient to input the initial conditions to determine who goes first, and how many pencils there are on the table.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Write a program that will satisfy the conditions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask users to input the number of pencils with the <code class="java">How many pencils</code> substring. Don't forget to read that number;</li>
<li>Ask users to input who goes first from the two players provided beforehand. To do it, output a substring in the following format: <code class="java">Who will be the first (*Name1*, *Name2*)</code>. Don't forget to read that name.</li>
<li>Print two lines: one with the number of pencils, the other with the <code class="java">*NameX* is going first</code> substrings </li>
</ol>
<p>You don't need to input players' names, just change the <code class="java">*Name1*</code> and <code class="java">*Name2*</code> substrings. Names can consist of the letters of the English alphabet and numbers only.</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">How many pencils would you like to use:
&gt; 5
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
&gt; John
|||||
John is going first!
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">How many pencils would you like to use:
&gt; 20
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
&gt; Jack
||||||||||||||||||||
Jack is going first!</code></pre>
